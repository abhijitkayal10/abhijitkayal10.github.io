## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **gender representation in movies** using the **Bechdel Test**, a widely used metric to evaluate how women are portrayed in films. Through **data analysis and visualization**, the project explores how movies perform across different Bechdel Test categories over time.

The visualizations clearly show trends such as:

* Movies with **fewer than two female characters**
* Movies where **female characters do not talk**
* Movies where women **only talk about men**
* Movies that **pass the Bechdel Test**

## ❓ What is the Bechdel Test?

A movie **passes the Bechdel Test** if:

1. It has **at least two named female characters**
2. They **talk to each other**
3. Their conversation is **not about a man**

While simple, the test is a powerful indicator of **gender bias and representation** in cinema.
